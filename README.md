Open/Closed Principle:
Your classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
That means when adding new functionality, you donâ€™t change existing code, but extend it using abstraction

How is the code now follows OCP ?

when i try to add new type of user ,  won't change the code .. just add new service wit new implementation and call it in the main to regitser it.
before OCP i would edit the dictionary by myself to add the new type .. and this will violate the OCP as i would edit the file.
